You should be able to use the default config if playing on a 1080p screen.
If your screen size is different or you're not playing in full-screen, you can press 'q' to create a new config.
After starting the config, click on all seven dice from top-left to bottom-right, then click the roll and sort buttons (in that order), and then click all of the score selection locations excluding the bonus. 
Finally, click the browser refresh page and press 'q' again to save the config. 
This only needs to be done once per computer assuming you keep the browser in the same location.
Also, the currently selected score tab resets after each choice, so that it is easier to keep track of after each roll.
Refer to the program console for any further instructions.
