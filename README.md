If your screen size is different or you're not playing in full-screen, you can press 'q' to create a new config.
After starting the config, click on all seven dice from top-left to bottom-right, then click the roll button, and then click all of the score selection locations excluding the bonus.
Also, the currently selected score tab resets after each choice, so that it is easier to keep track of after each roll.
